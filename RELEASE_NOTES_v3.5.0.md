## 🚀 What's New

### Hierarchical Command Organization

Commands are now organized in subdirectories by source:

```
commands/
├── ai-mesh/              # AI Mesh commands (12 commands)
│   ├── create-prd.md
│   ├── create-trd.md
│   ├── implement-trd.md
│   └── ... (9 more)
├── agent-os/             # Agent OS commands (future)
└── spec-kit/             # Spec Kit commands (future)
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier to distinguish AI Mesh vs third-party commands
- Better organization for growing command ecosystem
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Faster command discovery and resolution

### Automatic Migration System

The installation process now includes automatic migration:

1. **Backup Creation**: Automatic backup before migration
2. **Metadata Detection**: Identifies AI Mesh commands via `@ai-mesh-command` marker
3. **File Migration**: Moves files to `ai-mesh/` subdirectory
4. **YAML Updates**: Automatically rewrites command sources
5. **Validation**: Post-migration integrity checks
6. **Rollback**: Automatic restore on failure

**Performance**:
- Migration: 10ms for 24 files
- Validation: 160ms complete system check
- Zero downtime during upgrade

### Enhanced Validation System

New comprehensive validation system ensures installation integrity:

- File existence validation (24 files)
- YAML syntax validation
- Command resolution performance tests
- Detailed error reporting with recommendations

---

## 📦 Installation

### NPM Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Global installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global

# Local installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --local
```

**Migration happens automatically during installation.**

### Bash Installation (Legacy)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# Run installer
./install.sh --global
```

---

## 🔄 Upgrade from Previous Versions

### Automatic Upgrade

Simply run the installer - migration happens automatically:

```bash
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global
```

### What Happens During Upgrade

1. **Backup**: Your current `commands/` directory is backed up
2. **Detection**: AI Mesh commands are identified
3. **Migration**: Files moved to `ai-mesh/` subdirectory
4. **Validation**: System checks ensure everything works
5. **Complete**: Ready to use in seconds

**Backup Location**: `~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss/`

### Manual Verification (Optional)

```bash
# Verify migration completed successfully
ls ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/

# Should see 24 files (12 commands × 2 formats)
# Expected: create-prd.md, create-prd.txt, create-trd.md, ...
```
