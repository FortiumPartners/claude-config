## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: NPM Installation (Recommended) ✨ **NEW**

Professional Node.js installer with cross-platform support:

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g @fortium/ai-mesh
ai-mesh install --global

# Or use npx for one-time installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global

# Local project installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --local

# Update existing installation
ai-mesh update --global
```

**NPM Installation Benefits:**
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows support
- ✅ **Zero dependencies**: No bash, Python, or additional tools required
- ✅ **Professional CLI**: Interactive prompts with colored output
- ✅ **Smart update detection**: Automatically detects existing installations
- ✅ **Safe updates**: Separate update command prevents accidental overwrites
- ✅ **Automatic validation**: Comprehensive health checks
- ✅ **Error recovery**: Rollback capabilities and detailed logging
- ✅ **API access**: Programmatic interface for automation

#### Option 2: Legacy Installation (Compatibility)

For users who prefer the original bash script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config

# Run the interactive installer
./install.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# 1) Choose Global (1) or Local (2) installation
# 2) Automatic backup of existing configuration
# 3) Installation validation and verification
```

### Installation Modes

**Global Installation** (Recommended)
- Installs to `~/.claude/` (your home directory)
- Available to Claude Code across all projects
- Agents and commands work from any directory

**Local Installation** (Project-specific)
- Installs to `.claude/` (current project directory)
- Available only when working in this specific project
- Perfect for project-specific configurations

### 🔔 Important: Hook Installation Changes (v2.8.0)

**As of version 2.8.0, development hooks are NO LONGER installed by default.**

The hook framework (`hooks/` directory) has been removed from the standard installation process to provide a cleaner, more flexible setup. If you need the hook framework for activity tracking and metrics:

- **Hooks are available in the repository** but require manual setup
- **See `hooks/README.md`** for installation and configuration instructions
- **Activity tracking** can be enabled separately if needed for your workflow

This change improves installation speed and reduces complexity for users who don't require the hook framework.

### Post-Installation

```bash
# Restart Claude Code to load the new configuration

# Validate installation
ai-mesh validate
# or: npx @fortium/ai-mesh validate

# Explore available agents and commands
# Global: ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/
# Local: ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/ai-mesh/

# Use the fold-prompt command for project analysis
# (Command details available in commands/ai-mesh/fold-prompt.md)
```

### 🔄 Automatic Command Migration

The installer automatically detects and migrates commands from flat structure to organized subdirectories:

**What Happens During Installation:**
1. **Detection**: Installer scans for existing commands in flat structure
2. **Backup**: Creates timestamped backup of existing commands (`commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`)
3. **Migration**: Moves AI Mesh commands to `ai-mesh/` subdirectory
4. **YAML Update**: Automatically rewrites YAML files with new paths
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive post-migration checks ensure everything works

**Performance:**
- **Node.js Migration**: ~10ms for 24 command files (500x faster than target)
- **Bash Migration**: ~200ms for 24 command files (25x faster than target)
- **Validation**: ~160ms comprehensive checks

**Backward Compatibility:**
- All existing command invocations work unchanged (e.g., `/create-trd`)
- Claude Code natively resolves commands in subdirectories
- Zero breaking changes for end users

### Programmatic Installation (CI/CD)

For automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines:

```javascript
const { createInstaller, quickInstall, quickValidate } = require('@fortium/ai-mesh');

// Option 1: Full API control
const installer = createInstaller({
  scope: 'global',
  force: true,
  skipValidation: false
});

const result = await installer.install();
console.log('Installation success:', result.success);

// Option 2: Quick installation
const quickResult = await quickInstall({ scope: 'local' });

// Option 3: Quick validation
const isValid = await quickValidate();
console.log('Installation valid:', isValid.success);
```

### Advanced Features ✨ **NEW**

**CLI Management:**
```bash
# Update existing installation (recommended for updates)
ai-mesh update --tool claude --global

# The installer now detects existing installations and warns you to use update
# If you have an existing installation, use 'update' instead of 'install'

# Force reinstallation (overwrites all files)
ai-mesh install --global --force

# Skip environment validation (faster)
ai-mesh install --local --skip-validation

# Validate current installation
ai-mesh validate

# Get detailed help
ai-mesh install --help
```

**Update vs Install:**
- **`ai-mesh update`**: Use this to update an existing installation (automatically uses --force)
- **`ai-mesh install`**: Detects existing installations and prompts you to use update instead
- The installer protects you from accidentally overwriting configurations

**API Features:**
```javascript
// Check if already installed
const isInstalled = await installer.isInstalled('global');

// Get installation details
const validation = await installer.validate();
console.log(`Agents: ${validation.summary.agents}`);
console.log(`Commands: ${validation.summary.commands}`);
console.log(`Hooks: ${validation.summary.hooks}`);

// Error handling
try {
  await installer.install();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Installation failed:', error.message);
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Command Migration Issues

**Commands not found after installation:**
```bash
# Check if ai-mesh directory exists
ls ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/  # Global installation
ls .claude/commands/ai-mesh/    # Local installation

# Expected: 24 files (12 commands × 2 formats)
# If missing, check backup directory
ls ~/.claude/commands-backup-*/
```

**Migration failed during installation:**
```bash
# 1. Check for backup directory
ls ~/.claude/commands-backup-*

# 2. Manually restore if needed
cp -r ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/* ~/.claude/commands/

# 3. Re-run installation
ai-mesh install --global --force
```

**YAML paths not updated correctly:**
```bash
# Check YAML files for correct paths
cat ~/.claude/commands/yaml/create-trd.yaml | grep output_path
# Should show: output_path: "ai-mesh/create-trd.md"

# If incorrect, re-run validation which triggers YAML rewrite
ai-mesh validate
```

**Performance issues during migration:**
```bash
# Migration should be fast:
# - Node.js: ~10ms for 24 files
# - Bash: ~200ms for 24 files

# If slower, check disk I/O:
time ls -la ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/
```
