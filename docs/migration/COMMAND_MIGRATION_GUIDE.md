# Command Migration Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Production-Ready
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025
**Related:** [Command Directory Reorganization TRD](../TRD/command-directory-reorganization-trd.md)

---

## Overview

This guide explains the command directory reorganization from a flat structure to a hierarchical `ai-mesh/` subdirectory system. The migration is **fully automated** during installation and provides **zero breaking changes** for end users.

### What Changed

**Before (Flat Structure):**
```
commands/
├── create-prd.md
├── create-prd.txt
├── create-trd.md
├── create-trd.txt
├── fold-prompt.md
├── fold-prompt.txt
└── ... (24 files total)
```

**After (Hierarchical Structure):**
```
commands/
├── ai-mesh/                # AI Mesh commands
│   ├── create-prd.md
│   ├── create-prd.txt
│   ├── create-trd.md
│   ├── create-trd.txt
│   ├── fold-prompt.md
│   ├── fold-prompt.txt
│   └── ... (24 files total)
├── agent-os/               # Future: Agent OS commands
├── spec-kit/               # Future: Spec Kit commands
└── yaml/                   # YAML definitions (updated paths)
    ├── create-prd.yaml     # output_path: "ai-mesh/create-prd.md"
    ├── create-trd.yaml     # output_path: "ai-mesh/create-trd.md"
    └── ... (12 YAML files)
```

### Why This Change?

1. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of commands by product/category
2. **Scalability**: Room for future command collections (Agent OS, Spec Kit)
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and understand command structure
4. **Third-Party Support**: Clear separation between AI Mesh and external commands
5. **Future-Proof**: Extensible architecture for new command categories

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration (Recommended)

The migration happens automatically during installation:

```bash
# NPM installation (automatic migration included)
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global

# Or bash installation (automatic migration included)
./install.sh
```

**What Happens:**

1. **Detection Phase** (2-5ms)
   - Scans `commands/` directory for existing files
   - Identifies AI Mesh commands via `@ai-mesh-command` metadata
   - Checks if migration already completed

2. **Backup Phase** (5-10ms)
   - Creates timestamped backup: `commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
   - Preserves all existing files for rollback
   - Logs backup location for reference

3. **Migration Phase** (5-15ms)
   - Creates `ai-mesh/` subdirectory
   - Moves 24 command files (12 commands × 2 formats)
   - Preserves file permissions and timestamps
   - Continues with valid files, logs errors for problematic ones

4. **YAML Update Phase** (10-20ms)
   - Rewrites YAML files in `commands/yaml/`
   - Updates `output_path` fields: `"create-trd.md"` → `"ai-mesh/create-trd.md"`
   - Preserves all other YAML content unchanged
   - Validates YAML syntax after rewriting

5. **Validation Phase** (50-100ms)
   - Verifies all 24 command files exist in `ai-mesh/`
   - Checks YAML files have correct paths
   - Ensures file integrity and readability
   - Reports any issues found

**Total Time:** 10-50ms (Node.js) or 200-500ms (Bash)

### Manual Migration (If Needed)

If automatic migration fails or you need to migrate manually:

#### Step 1: Create Backup

```bash
# Navigate to installation directory
cd ~/.claude  # Global installation
# OR
cd .claude    # Local installation

# Create backup
cp -r commands/ commands-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/
```

#### Step 2: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p commands/ai-mesh
mkdir -p commands/agent-os
mkdir -p commands/spec-kit
```

#### Step 3: Move Command Files

```bash
# Move all AI Mesh commands (12 commands × 2 formats = 24 files)
mv commands/create-prd.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/create-prd.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/create-trd.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/create-trd.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/implement-trd.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/implement-trd.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/fold-prompt.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/fold-prompt.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/manager-dashboard.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/manager-dashboard.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/analyze-product.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/analyze-product.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/refine-prd.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/refine-prd.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/refine-trd.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/refine-trd.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/sprint-status.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/sprint-status.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/playwright-test.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/playwright-test.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/generate-api-docs.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/generate-api-docs.txt commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/web-metrics-dashboard.md commands/ai-mesh/
mv commands/web-metrics-dashboard.txt commands/ai-mesh/
```

#### Step 4: Update YAML Files

Edit each YAML file in `commands/yaml/` to update the `output_path`:

```bash
# Example: commands/yaml/create-trd.yaml
# Before:
output_path: "create-trd.md"

# After:
output_path: "ai-mesh/create-trd.md"
```

**YAML Files to Update:**
- `create-prd.yaml`
- `create-trd.yaml`
- `implement-trd.yaml`
- `fold-prompt.yaml`
- `manager-dashboard.yaml`
- `analyze-product.yaml`
- `refine-prd.yaml`
- `refine-trd.yaml`
- `sprint-status.yaml`
- `playwright-test.yaml`
- `generate-api-docs.yaml`
- `web-metrics-dashboard.yaml`

#### Step 5: Validate Migration

```bash
# Check file count
ls -1 commands/ai-mesh/ | wc -l
# Expected: 24 files

# Verify YAML paths
grep -r "output_path" commands/yaml/ | grep -v "ai-mesh"
# Expected: No output (all paths should include "ai-mesh/")

# Test command resolution
# Restart Claude Code and try: /create-trd
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Found After Migration

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Code doesn't recognize commands
- `/create-trd` shows "command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Verify ai-mesh directory exists
ls ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/

# 2. Check file count (should be 24)
ls -1 ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/ | wc -l

# 3. If files missing, restore from backup
ls ~/.claude/commands-backup-*/
cp -r ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/* ~/.claude/commands/

# 4. Re-run installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global --force
```

### Migration Failed During Installation

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages during `npm install` or `./install.sh`
- Migration incomplete or stuck

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check for backup
ls ~/.claude/commands-backup-*

# 2. If backup exists, restore it
cp -r ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/* ~/.claude/commands/
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/  # Clean partial migration

# 3. Check permissions
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x (755 permissions)

# 4. Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 ~/.claude/commands/

# 5. Re-run installation with verbose logging
DEBUG=ai-mesh:* npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global
```

### YAML Paths Not Updated

**Symptoms:**
- Commands generate files in wrong location
- Claude Code creates files at root instead of `ai-mesh/`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check YAML paths
cat ~/.claude/commands/yaml/create-trd.yaml | grep output_path
# Should show: output_path: "ai-mesh/create-trd.md"

# 2. If incorrect, manually run YAML rewriter
cd /path/to/claude-config
node src/installer/yaml-rewriter.js ~/.claude/commands

# 3. Or re-run validation (triggers YAML rewrite)
npx @fortium/ai-mesh validate

# 4. Verify fix
grep -r "output_path" ~/.claude/commands/yaml/ | grep -v "ai-mesh"
# Expected: No output
```

### Performance Issues During Migration

**Symptoms:**
- Migration takes longer than expected (>1 second)
- Installation appears stuck

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check disk I/O performance
time ls -la ~/.claude/commands/

# 2. Verify no filesystem issues
df -h ~/.claude/

# 3. Check for permission issues
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/ | grep "^d"

# 4. Monitor migration with verbose logging
DEBUG=ai-mesh:migration npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global

# 5. If persistent, use bash installer (more robust)
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git
cd claude-config
./install.sh
```

### Partial Migration (Some Files Moved, Some Not)

**Symptoms:**
- Some commands work, others don't
- Mixed files in root and `ai-mesh/`

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. List files in both locations
ls ~/.claude/commands/*.md
ls ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/*.md

# 2. Move remaining files manually
for file in ~/.claude/commands/*.md; do
  mv "$file" ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/
done

for file in ~/.claude/commands/*.txt; do
  mv "$file" ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/
done

# 3. Verify all files moved
ls ~/.claude/commands/*.md 2>/dev/null
# Expected: No such file or directory

# 4. Update YAML paths
node src/installer/yaml-rewriter.js ~/.claude/commands
```

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to revert to the flat structure:

### Step 1: Identify Backup

```bash
# Find latest backup
ls -lt ~/.claude/commands-backup-* | head -1
```

### Step 2: Stop Claude Code

```bash
# Close all Claude Code windows
# Or force quit if needed
pkill -f "Claude Code"
```

### Step 3: Restore Backup

```bash
# Remove migrated structure
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/agent-os/
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/spec-kit/

# Restore from backup
cp -r ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/* ~/.claude/commands/

# Or move backup back (faster)
rm -rf ~/.claude/commands/
mv ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS ~/.claude/commands
```

### Step 4: Revert YAML Files

If YAML files were updated, restore them:

```bash
# If you have YAML backups
cp ~/.claude/commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/yaml/*.yaml ~/.claude/commands/yaml/

# Or manually edit to remove "ai-mesh/" prefix
# change: output_path: "ai-mesh/create-trd.md"
# to: output_path: "create-trd.md"
```

### Step 5: Verify Rollback

```bash
# Check files are in root
ls ~/.claude/commands/*.md | wc -l
# Expected: 12 files

# Verify no ai-mesh directory
ls ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/ 2>/dev/null
# Expected: No such file or directory

# Restart Claude Code and test
```

## FAQs

### Q: Will this break my existing commands?

**A:** No. Claude Code natively resolves commands in subdirectories. All existing command invocations (e.g., `/create-trd`) work unchanged.

### Q: Do I need to update my workflows?

**A:** No. The migration is transparent to users. Commands work exactly as before.

### Q: What if I have custom commands?

**A:** Custom commands without the `@ai-mesh-command` metadata are not affected. They remain in the root `commands/` directory.

### Q: Can I disable automatic migration?

**A:** Not currently. The migration is part of the installation process. However, you can rollback if needed (see Rollback Procedure).

### Q: What if migration fails?

**A:** Automatic backups are created. You can restore from `commands-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` directory.

### Q: How do I verify migration completed successfully?

```bash
# Check file count (should be 24)
ls -1 ~/.claude/commands/ai-mesh/ | wc -l

# Check YAML paths (should all include "ai-mesh/")
grep -r "output_path" ~/.claude/commands/yaml/

# Run validation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh validate
```

### Q: Can I have multiple command subdirectories?

**A:** Yes. The architecture supports `ai-mesh/`, `agent-os/`, `spec-kit/`, and any custom subdirectories you create.

### Q: What about third-party commands?

**A:** Third-party commands should include metadata markers (e.g., `@vendor-command`) and can be organized in their own subdirectories during installation.
