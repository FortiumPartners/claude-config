## Feedback Analysis

### Automated Analysis

**Metrics Dashboard**: `docs/beta/BETA_METRICS_DASHBOARD.md`

**Key Metrics**:
1. **Installation Success Rate**
   - Target: ‚â•98%
   - Formula: successful_installs / total_installs

2. **Migration Success Rate**
   - Target: ‚â•99%
   - Formula: successful_migrations / total_migrations

3. **Average Migration Time**
   - Target: <100ms
   - Formula: sum(migration_durations) / count

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - Target: ‚â•90% (4+ stars)
   - Formula: (4_and_5_star_ratings) / total_ratings

5. **Error Rate**
   - Target: <1%
   - Formula: (installations_with_errors) / total_installs

### Manual Review Process

**Weekly Review Schedule**:

**Monday**: Collect telemetry from previous week

## Feedback Examples

### Good Feedback Examples

**Bug Report**:
```
Title: Migration fails on Windows with permission error
Description: During installation on Windows 10, migration fails with "EPERM" error.
Steps to reproduce:

Suggested syntax: npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global --dry-run
```

**General Feedback**:
```
Title: Documentation is excellent!
Description: The migration guide was very clear and helpful. Installation went smoothly. Impressed with the performance - migration took less than a second!
Suggestion: Maybe add a video walkthrough for first-time users?
```
