# Product Requirements Document: Command Directory Reorganization

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Status:** Refined - Ready for TRD Conversion
**Created:** October 28, 2025
**Last Refined:** October 29, 2025
**Owner:** Fortium Software Configuration Team
**Priority:** Medium

---

## Executive Summary

Reorganize Claude Code slash commands under a dedicated `ai-mesh/` directory structure within `.claude/commands/` to improve discoverability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. This change will make it easier for users to distinguish between AI Mesh commands, AgentOS standards, and third-party command libraries (like spec-kit).

### Problem Statement

Currently, all command files (AI Mesh, AgentOS, and potentially third-party) are mixed together in a flat directory structure within `~/.claude/commands/`. This creates several challenges:

1. **Discoverability Issues**: Users cannot easily identify which commands belong to AI Mesh vs. other systems
2. **Maintenance Complexity**: Updates to AI Mesh commands require careful identification to avoid touching AgentOS or spec-kit files
3. **Namespace Collisions**: Risk of command name conflicts between different systems
4. **Unclear Ownership**: No visual indication of which team/system maintains each command
5. **Scalability Concerns**: As the command library grows, flat structure becomes increasingly unwieldy

### Solution Overview

Implement a hierarchical directory structure that groups commands by origin/purpose:

```
~/.claude/commands/
├── ai-mesh/                    # Fortium AI Mesh commands
│   ├── create-prd.md
│   ├── create-trd.md
│   ├── implement-trd.md
│   ├── fold-prompt.md
│   ├── manager-dashboard.md
│   └── ...
├── agent-os/                   # AgentOS standard commands
│   └── ...
└── spec-kit/                   # Third-party command libraries
    └── ...
```

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Users can quickly identify AI Mesh commands vs. other systems
2. **Cleaner Namespace**: Reduce risk of command name conflicts
3. **Better Maintenance**: Easier to update AI Mesh commands without touching other systems
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing command invocations (e.g., `/create-trd`) continue to work
5. **Professional Organization**: Industry-standard directory structure for extensible systems

### Non-Goals

1. **Breaking Changes**: No changes to command invocation syntax or behavior
2. **Command Renaming**: Keep existing command names and aliases
3. **Runtime Performance**: No measurable impact on command execution speed
4. **AgentOS Changes**: Do not modify AgentOS standards or their location
5. **Third-Party Migration**: Do not force migration of existing third-party commands

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Changes

**Before**:
```
~/.claude/commands/
├── create-prd.md
├── create-trd.md
├── implement-trd.md
└── ... (12 total files)
```

**After**:
```
~/.claude/commands/
└── ai-mesh/
    ├── create-prd.md
    ├── create-trd.md
    ├── implement-trd.md
    └── ... (12 total files)
```

### Migration Strategy

**Selected Strategy: Immediate Migration (Option 1)**

**Decision Rationale**: Provides cleaner codebase, faster adoption, and eliminates maintenance burden of supporting multiple structures.

**Implementation Details**:
- New installations use new structure immediately
- Existing installations automatically migrate on next update (no opt-out)
- Automatic rolling backup before migration (retained until next successful install)
- One-click rollback if issues detected
- Enhanced CLI with progress bars and status indicators

**User Communication**:
- At update time only via in-app CLI messaging
- Clear migration status and progress display
- Detailed error reporting if issues occur

**No Opt-Out Policy**: All users must migrate to ensure consistency and simplify long-term maintenance. This decision enforces uniformity across all installations and reduces support complexity.

### Backward Compatibility

Claude Code command resolution inherently supports subdirectories:
- `/create-trd` resolves to `commands/ai-mesh/create-trd.md` automatically
- No changes to command invocation required
- Command help displays full path (e.g., "ai-mesh/create-trd") for clarity and discoverability
- Command completion shows hierarchical paths (e.g., `/ai-mesh/create-prd`, `/ai-mesh/create-trd`) to reinforce organizational structure

### Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Command resolution breaks | High | Low | Comprehensive testing + rollback mechanism |
| Installation failures increase | High | Low | Dry-run mode + validation checks |
| User confusion during transition | Medium | Medium | Clear migration guide + in-app messaging |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Very Low | Benchmark testing + monitoring |
| Third-party command conflicts | Low | Low | Clear namespace separation |

---

## Resolved Questions

1. **Q**: Should we provide an opt-out mechanism for users who prefer flat structure?
   - **A**: **No opt-out mechanism**. All users must migrate to ensure consistency and reduce maintenance complexity.

2. **Q**: How do we handle third-party commands installed by users?
   - **A**: Leave them in place; only migrate AI Mesh commands. **Detection method**: Metadata headers (e.g., `# @ai-mesh-command`) in AI Mesh command files to distinguish from third-party commands.

3. **Q**: Should command help text show full path or just command name?
   - **A**: **Full path** (e.g., "ai-mesh/create-trd") to make organization explicit and improve discoverability.

4. **Q**: Do we need a migration dashboard or is CLI sufficient?
   - **A**: **Enhanced CLI with progress bars, colors, and detailed status** - provides excellent UX without web complexity.

5. **Q**: What happens when non-critical errors occur during migration?
   - **A**: **Partial migration** - Continue with valid files, log errors for manual resolution, display detailed warning report at completion.

6. **Q**: How should YAML source files be updated?
   - **A**: **Automatic path rewriting** - Installer automatically updates YAML files in `commands/yaml/` to reference new directory structure.

7. **Q**: How long should migration backups be retained?
   - **A**: **Rolling backup** - Keep only the most recent backup, automatically replaced on next successful migration (minimal disk space usage).

8. **Q**: How should performance baseline be validated?
   - **A**: **Automated CI/CD testing** - Integrate performance tests into CI pipeline with < 100ms threshold for command resolution.

9. **Q**: What is the user communication strategy?
   - **A**: **At update time only** - Display clear migration notice and progress during installer execution (no advanced notice or multi-channel campaign).

10. **Q**: How should command completion work?
    - **A**: **Hierarchical completion** - Show full paths (e.g., `/ai-mesh/create-prd`) to expose and reinforce directory structure.
