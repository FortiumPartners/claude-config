## Running Performance Tests

### Local Execution
```bash
# Run all performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run specific suite
npm test -- src/__tests__/performance/benchmark-suite.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:performance:coverage

# Run command resolution tests only
npm test -- src/__tests__/performance/command-resolution.test.js
```

### CI/CD Execution
Performance tests run automatically on:
- Every pull request
- Every push to main branch
- Nightly builds (comprehensive suite)

### Manual Validation
```bash
# Validate coverage thresholds
npm run coverage:check

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage:report

# Run full validation
npm run validate
```

## Performance Regression Prevention

### Automated Monitoring
- Performance baselines stored in repo
- Automated comparison on every PR
- Alerts on >10% performance degradation
- Trend tracking over time

### Manual Review Process
1. Review performance test results in PR
2. Check for threshold violations
3. Investigate any regressions
4. Approve only if performance maintained

## Recommendations for Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
- Weekly review of performance trends
- Monthly coverage audits
- Quarterly performance optimization sprints

### Threshold Updates
- Review targets annually
- Adjust based on hardware improvements
- Document any threshold changes

### Test Maintenance
- Keep tests up-to-date with code changes
- Remove obsolete tests
- Add tests for new features
- Maintain >85% coverage
