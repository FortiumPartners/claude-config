## MCP Server Integration

### Required MCP Servers (Leo's Process)

#### Context7 - Versioned Documentation

**Purpose**: Inject version-specific docs and examples directly into prompts
**Reduces**: API/versioning errors through authoritative vendor documentation
**Setup**: `claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest`

#### Playwright MCP - Browser Automation & E2E Testing

**Purpose**: Browser automation and E2E testing as callable tools from agents  
**Capabilities**: Cross-browser testing, visual regression, performance metrics
**Setup**: `claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`

#### Linear/Jira - Vendor-Neutral Ticketing

**Purpose**: Connect preferred tracker through MCP servers
**Integration**: Status updates, requirement linking, artifact attachment
**Setup**: Various based on vendor (Linear, Atlassian, etc.)

### MCP Integration Patterns

- **Context7**: Auto-invoked by context-fetcher for vendor documentation
- **Playwright**: Used by playwright-tester for E2E test execution
- **Ticketing**: Updated throughout workflow for status and artifact tracking

### Authentication & Activity Tracking

#### Real-Time Activity Feed Integration

The hooks system now includes comprehensive user authentication for accurate activity tracking:

```bash
# Get your authentication token (simple)
node hooks/get-auth-token.js

# View your complete profile
node hooks/user-profile.js show

# Update your profile
node hooks/user-profile.js update --name="New Name" --email="new@email.com"

# Reset and recreate profile
node hooks/user-profile.js reset
```

#### Backend Integration (Optional)

For teams using the External Metrics Web Service:

```bash
# Set the backend URL for hook integration
export METRICS_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api/v1

# Your authentication token is automatically used from ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json
# Activities will appear in the Real-Time Activity Feed with proper user attribution
```

**Activity Data Includes:**
- User identification (name, email, unique ID)
- Tool execution metrics (performance, success/failure)
- Agent invocations (subagent type, task descriptions)
- File operations (paths, changes, line counts)
- Session tracking (duration, productivity scores)

## Standard Development Workflow (Leo's Process)

### From Ticket to Merge - Complete Flow

#### Step 1: Planning & Scope (`/plan`)

```
Input: Ticket ID + constraints + goal + context
Flow: AI Mesh Orchestrator → tech-lead-orchestrator + context-fetcher
Output: Clear TRD with acceptance criteria and task breakdown
```

#### Step 2: Create/Update Ticket

```
Flow: Update ticket via Ticketing MCP with TRD, criteria, and links
Validation: Status, assignee, labels, concrete testable ACs
```

#### Step 3: Implementation (`/build`)

```
Flow: git-workflow → implement incrementally → test-runner after each step
Strategy: Part A (API/schema) → Part B (service) → Part C (UI)
Output: Unit and integration tests passing, idiomatic code
```

#### Step 4: E2E Testing (`/test e2e`)

```
Flow: playwright-tester generates/updates specs, runs with traces
Validation: Covers acceptance criteria, stable selectors, auth helpers
Output: Green E2E suite with artifacts for debugging
```

#### Step 5: Quality Gate (`/review`)

```
Flow: code-reviewer enforces DoD (security, performance, maintainability)
Requirements: All high-severity findings addressed, tests still green
Output: Security validated, performance checked, patches applied
```

#### Step 6: Documentation & PR (`/document`)

```
Flow: git-workflow creates PR + documentation-specialist updates docs
Output: CHANGELOG, migration notes, clear PR with TRD summary
```

#### Step 7: Merge & Close

```
Flow: Ticketing MCP updates status, work-completion-summary for stakeholders
Result: Ticket closed, PR merged, documentation updated, tests green on CI
```

### Quality Gates (Definition of Done)

**Prerequisites**: macOS/Linux, Node 18+, Git, Claude Code installed

#### 1. MCP Server Setup (Optional - enhances functionality)

```bash
# Install recommended MCP servers
claude mcp add context7 --scope user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
claude mcp add linear --scope user -- npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse

# Verify installation
claude mcp list
```

#### 2. Deploy Sub-Agent Mesh (Professional NPM Installation)

```bash
# Option 1: NPM-based installation (Recommended)
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --global

# Option 2: Local project installation
npx @fortium/ai-mesh install --local

# Option 3: Legacy bash installation
git clone https://github.com/FortiumPartners/claude-config.git && cd claude-config
./install.sh

# NPM Installation Features:
# 1. Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
# 2. Interactive scope selection (global/local)
# 3. Automatic dependency management
# 4. Progress tracking with detailed logging
# 5. Comprehensive validation and health checks
# 6. Rollback capabilities and error recovery
# 7. Professional CLI with colored output

# Available Commands:

# ai-mesh install --local     # Local installation
# ai-mesh validate           # Validate installation
# ai-mesh update             # Update existing installation
# ai-mesh --help             # Show help and options
```

#### 3. User Authentication Setup (Required for Activity Tracking)

```bash
# Set up your developer profile for metrics and activity tracking
cd ~/.claude  # or your local installation directory

# Option 1: Quick setup with current git config (Recommended)
node hooks/user-profile.js

# Option 2: Custom setup with your details
node hooks/user-profile.js setup --email="your@company.com" --name="Your Name"

# Option 3: Organization-specific setup
node hooks/user-profile.js setup --email="your@company.com" --name="Your Name" --org="your-org-id"

# Verify your profile and get your auth token
node hooks/user-profile.js show

# Quick way to get just your auth token
node hooks/get-auth-token.js
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a unique user ID and secure authentication token
- Enables proper attribution in Real-Time Activity Feed
- Allows productivity metrics to be tracked per developer
- Auto-detects name/email from git config if not specified

#### 4. Post-Installation Verification

```bash
# Installation automatically validates, but for manual verification:

# Global installation check:
ls ~/.claude/agents/ ~/.claude/commands/

# Local installation check:
ls .claude/agents/ .claude/commands/

# Verify user profile exists:
ls ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json

# Restart Claude Code to load new configuration
# Test commands:
# /plan-product "describe your product idea"
# /analyze-product
# /create-trd @docs/PRD/your-product.md
# /implement-trd @docs/TRD/your-product-trd.md
# /fold-prompt
```

### External Tool Integration

- **Version Control**: Git hooks and workflow automation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Deployment and testing integration
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance and health check integration
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, and email notification workflows

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Common Issues

#### Authentication & Activity Tracking
- **No Activities in Feed**: Check if user profile exists (`node hooks/user-profile.js show`)
- **Wrong User Attribution**: Update profile (`node hooks/user-profile.js update --email="correct@email.com"`)
- **Hook Performance Issues**: Hooks fall back to local storage if backend unavailable (expected behavior)
- **Missing Backend Connection**: Set `METRICS_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api/v1` for Real-Time Feed integration

#### MCP & System Integration
- **MCP Auth Issues**: Follow vendor OAuth flows; re-add servers if tokens expire
- **Commands Not Visible**: Restart Claude Code; verify MCP servers listed
- **Agent Permission Errors**: Keep tool permissions minimal; grant Bash/MCP tools only when needed
- **Process Improvement**: Use meta-agent to refactor prompts when patterns emerge

#### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Reset user authentication
node hooks/user-profile.js reset

# Check hook performance
node hooks/tool-metrics.js Read '{"file_path": "/tmp/test.txt"}' true

# Verify installation
ls ~/.ai-mesh/profile/user.json
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Agent Orchestration Best Practices

- **Minimal Tools**: Start with Read/Edit; add Bash/MCP tools only when required
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent has explicit mission and handoff contracts
- **Continuous Improvement**: Evolve agent prompts based on usage patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Enforce DoD through code-reviewer before any PR merge

## Neovim Diff Preview Tools

IMPORTANT: This project has Neovim diff preview tools available. You MUST use these tools for ALL file operations:

- **ALWAYS use `nvim_edit_with_diff`** instead of `Edit` for editing files
- **ALWAYS use `nvim_write_with_diff`** instead of `Write` for writing/creating files

These tools will show changes in Neovim before applying them, allowing the user to review and approve/reject changes interactively.

### Why use these tools?
1. Users can see exactly what changes will be made before they're applied
2. Changes can be reviewed in Neovim's familiar diff interface
3. Users maintain full control over what modifications are accepted

### Usage:
When you need to edit or write files, use:
- `nvim_edit_with_diff` with parameters: file_path, old_string, new_string
- `nvim_write_with_diff` with parameters: file_path, content

DO NOT use the standard Edit/Write tools when these Neovim-specific tools are available.
